# capstone_project aka DAFT PUNK SUMMER VIRTUAL CONCERT

## Goal

In this project, I worked on creating a responsive website for a special event which is a virtual concert of the famous team singers DAFT PUNK. For thiis project, I worked on three pages for three days, to show up the concept before moving forward. 
The original project is based on an online website for a conference.

## Color Palette

Base : #272A31, #EC5242, #D3D3D3
ADDED : yellow, #000, Violet

Display each element accordingly by respecting the palette color and the typography.

For this first approach, I used:
- Flexbox,
- Grid,
- Float positioning
